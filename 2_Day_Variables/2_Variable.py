##____Python - Variable Names____

##___Variable Names___

# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

#Example:

#Legal variable names:
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
#use print to print the value



##___Multi Words Variable Names___##

# Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

# There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

##____Camel Case____##

#Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "John"
#use print to print the value  
    
    
    
##____Pascal Case_____##

#Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "John"
#use print to print the value   
    
    
    
##_____Snake Case_____##

#Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "John"
